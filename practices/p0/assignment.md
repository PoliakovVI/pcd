# Setting up for the course

The goal for this practice is to give an overview of tools which are going to be used during this course. Some knowledge of c++, CMake and git is assumed.

1. Download & install [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. Install the following plugins (strictly recommended)
    1. c/c++ - for c++ intellisense
    1. CMake/CMakeTools - for CMake source highlighting and autocomplete
    1. LLVM - for LLVM IR syntax highlighting
    1. Ocaml Platform - for Ocaml source highlighting and autocomplete (will be used later in this course)
    1. Remote - accessing remove hosts over SSH inside VScode (if host and client going to be different)
1. Check if you have requirements installed on your system ([information for *nix systems](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements))
